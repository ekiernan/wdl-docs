# Meta
This documentation is in the process of being updated. In the meantime, you may find that some GATK commands are out of date, or that the WDL information is incomplete. If you encounter any issues you can't solve, please let us know.

The meta component is an optional property of a task. It is intended to store metadata such as the author or contact email of a task. Any key/value pairs can be used.

Usage example
meta {
    author: "Broad Institute DSDE"
}
